# Greetings, ðŸ‘‹

## Research Intern at LAIT in UNIST AIGS

I'm actively engaged in cutting-edge projects at the intersection of AI and biotech. Here's a glimpse of my recent work in 2024:

- **LAIT internship**  
  Research on interpretability of generative models

- [MuSe2024 Challenge](https://github.com/kyleok/MuSe2024)  
  Advancing multimodal social perception analysis (repository in progress)
  
- [Thesis: AI Interpretability in Medical Imaging](https://github.com/ugent-korea/attention_maps/)  
  Exploring the potential of attention maps to address the interpretability crisis in AI-assisted medical imaging

- [AI Summer School (AISS) 2024](https://github.com/powersimmani/AISS2024) and [RC4 seminar](https://github.com/powersimmani/RC4_IRTP_Seminar_2024_Summer)  
  Serving as a mentor to nurture the next generation of AI enthusiasts
